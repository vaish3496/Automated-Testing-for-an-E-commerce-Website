## Test Planning

### Test Strategy Document

#### Objectives of Testing
The primary objectives of testing the e-commerce website are to ensure its functionality, usability, and performance meet the specified requirements. Additionally, we aim to identify and mitigate risks associated with the software.

#### Scope of Testing
The scope of testing includes all critical features of the e-commerce website, including but not limited to user registration, product search, adding items to the cart, checkout process, and order management.

#### Testing Levels
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components in isolation.
- Integration Testing: Testing the integration of components to ensure they function correctly together.
- System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole to validate end-to-end functionality.
- Acceptance Testing: Validating that the system meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.

#### Testing Types
- Functional Testing: Validating the functional aspects of the website's features.
- Usability Testing: Assessing the user-friendliness and intuitiveness of the interface.
- Performance Testing: Evaluating the website's responsiveness, scalability, and reliability under various load conditions.

#### Entry and Exit Criteria
- Entry Criteria: Availability of the latest build, completion of necessary environment setup, and availability of test data.
- Exit Criteria: Successful completion of all test cases, satisfactory performance under load testing, and resolution of critical defects.

#### Test Environment and Tools
- Test Environment: Multiple environments including development, testing, staging, and production.
- Testing Tools: Selenium WebDriver for automated testing, JMeter for performance testing, and a combination of manual and automated testing tools for functional and usability testing.

#### Risk Analysis
Identified risks include potential security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues with different browsers and devices, performance bottlenecks under high traffic, and data integrity issues during transactions.

### Test Plan

#### Test Deliverables
- Test Strategy Document
- Test Cases
- Automated Test Scripts
- Test Reports

#### Test Schedule
- Week 1: Test Environment Setup
- Week 2-3: Test Case Design and Documentation
- Week 4-5: Test Execution
- Week 6: Test Reporting and Analysis

#### Test Resources
- Human Resources: QA Engineers for test case design and execution, Developers for fixing defects.
- Tools: Selenium WebDriver, JMeter, Bug tracking tools (e.g., Jira), Test management tools (e.g., TestRail).

#### Test Data and Environment Setup
- Test Data: Generated using scripts or obtained from sample datasets. 
- Test Environment Setup: Replication of production environment with necessary configurations.

#### Test Execution and Reporting
- Test Execution: Automated tests executed using Selenium WebDriver, manual tests performed by QA Engineers.
- Test Reporting: Test results documented in test reports, defects logged in bug tracking tools, and progress tracked in test management tools.
